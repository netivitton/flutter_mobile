Argon Flutter is a free mobile UI template built with Google's [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) allowing you to create powerful and beautiful mobile applications.. We have redesigned all the usual components in order to make it look like Argon's Design System, minimalistic and easy to use.

Start your development with a badass Design System for Flutter inspired by Argon Design System. If you like Argon's Design System, you will love this Flutter app template! It features a huge number of components and screens built to fit together and look amazing. 


### Example Screens
If you want to get inspiration or just show something directly to your clients, you can jump start your development with our pre-built example screens. From onboarding screens to profile or discover screens, you will be able to quickly set up the basic structure for your Flutter mobile project.
